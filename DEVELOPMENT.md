# Extending the Adventure Assignment

I was directed by my code moderator to make the following changes:

## Smaller changes:
* Using return (condition) in Direction instead of if else statement
* Renaming readURL to readUrl in Layout
* Creating more new lines in readURL
* Renaming getRoomForDirection to getRoomFromDirection
* Using /** */ for comments regarding descriptions rather than //
* Magic number in formatDirections

## Changes that require more restructuring:
* Adding another class to keep track of game state and input handling
* Consider a Player class to keep track of location
* Decreasing size of main function

I will begin this assignment with these changes - stay tuned for more updates :sunglasses:
